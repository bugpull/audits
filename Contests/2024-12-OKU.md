## [H-01] Cancel doesn't remove orders mappings, allowing attacker to modify it to extract funds again

### Summary

in `Bracket.sol` `stopLimit.sol` and `oracleLess.sol`  
A vulnerability in the contract allows users to drain funds by exploiting the order cancellation and modification flow, where cancelled orders remain in the orders mapping but their funds are refunded, allowing subsequent modifications to re-claim funds.

### Root Cause

The `cancelOrder()` function only removes the order from `pendingOrderIds` array but does not delete the order data from the `orders` mapping. This allows the order to still exist and be modifiable via `modifyOrder()` even after cancellation and refund.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Order exists in the contract
- Order is owned by the attacker
- Order data remains in `orders` mapping after cancellation

### External pre-conditions

- User has enough tokens to create initial order
- User is the recipient of the order

### Attack Path

1. User creates an order with X amount of tokenIn
2. User calls `cancelOrder()` which:
    - Removes order from pendingOrderIds array
    - Refunds X tokens to user
    - Keeps order data in orders mapping
3. User calls `modifyOrder()` on the cancelled order:
    - Passes validation since order data still exists
    - Can modify order parameters and receive additional tokens when the `bool` `increasePosition` is false
4. User can repeat step 3 multiple times

### Impact

- Direct theft of user funds
- Protocol can be drained of tokens
- Loss of user and protocol funds
- Breaking of accounting logic

### Mitigation

Add order deletion from the mapping in `_cancelOrder()`:

```solidity
function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
    for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
        if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
            // Remove from pending array
            pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(i, pendingOrderIds);
            
            // Delete order from mapping
            delete orders[order.orderId]; // Add this line
            
            // Refund tokenIn
            order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);
            
            emit OrderCancelled(order.orderId);
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

## [H-02] in oracleLess, attacker can create two orders in same block to steal funds

### Summary

Critical vulnerability in `oracleLess.sol` where users can create multiple orders in same block to get same orderId, allowing theft of funds through order cancellation.

### Root Cause

```solidity
orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
orders[orderId] = Order({
    orderId: orderId,
    tokenIn: tokenIn,
    tokenOut: tokenOut,
    amountIn: amountIn, // Can be overwritten
    // ...
});
```

Same orderId used for multiple orders in same block, overwriting previous order data but maintaining multiple entries in `pendingOrderIds`.

### Internal pre-conditions

- No nonce tracking for orders
- Orders created in same block get same ID
- pendingOrderIds allows duplicate IDs

### External pre-conditions

- User can batch transactions in same block
- User has funds for initial small order

### Attack Path

1. Create first order with 1 wei tokenIn
2. In same block, create second order with large amountIn
3. Both orders have same ID in pendingOrderIds
4. Second order overwrites first in orders mapping
5. Cancel order twice to withdraw large amount twice

### Impact

- Direct theft of funds
- Double withdrawal possible
- Protocol fund drainage
  
## [H-03] cross function reentrency to cause loss of funds to user by malicious `target`

### Summary

A cross-function reentrancy vulnerability exists `oracleLess.sol` and `Bracket.sol` where malicious contracts can reenter during order execution to manipulate the pending orders array.

### Root Cause

```solidity
function performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external override nonReentrant {
    // ... decode and setup
    
    (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
        data.target,//@audit this target address is caller controlled and can be anything
        data.txData,//@audit the txData is caller controlled and can bee anything
        order.amountIn,
        order.tokenIn,
        order.tokenOut,
        bips
    );
    
    //@audit Vulnerable state change after external call
    pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
        data.pendingOrderIdx,
        pendingOrderIds
    );
}
```

### Attack Path

1. Create malicious `target` contract:

```solidity
contract target {
    function fallback(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external {
        //we fall back to cancel our user first and it will get cancelled normally
        Bracket(msg.sender).cancelOrder(targetOrderId);
        
        //we transfer 1 wei of token out to bracket to buypass the check of minimumAmountOut has to be > change in balance
        tokenOut.safetransfer(msg.sender, 1);
        
        //Its important to know that user can carry thins attack for no cost.
        return true;
    }
}
```

1. Malicious user create an order with max slippage (accepting 0 tokens), his index is 12 in the array
2. array of pending orders grow to have 60 indices
3. User performUpKeep on his own order reentering the contract at cancelOrder function to cancell his own order while sending 1 wei of token out to the contract to bypass the check at minAmountOut that checks that balance change has to be > slippage set
4. The `ArrayMutation.removeFromArray` in `performUpKeep` will instead remove another user order index

### Impact

If it was intended to not check for `pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId` in `modifyOrder` then the impact is unauthorized order cancellation only for other user

If it was a mistake not checking for `pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId` in `modifyOrder` (which is actually another bug) then the impact is complete loss of funds for that user that got his order index deleted

### Mitigation

Apply CEI pattern:

## [H-04] users that gave approvals to `stopLimit` contract can be drained

### Summary

in `StopLimit` contract users with existing token approvals can be exploited through malicious order creation with extreme slippage parameters, enabling sandwich attacks to extract value.

### Root Cause

The contract accepts arbitrary slippage parameters without validation against reasonable bounds, and any one can create orders for any one and tokens will be taken from the person the order is created for not the `msg.sender`

### Internal pre-conditions

- Contract accepts unlimited slippage values
- No validation of reasonable slippage bounds
- any one can create orders for any one and tokens will be taken from the person the order is created for not the `msg.sender`

### External pre-conditions

- User has given token approval to StopLimit contract
- Approval amount sufficient for exploitation
- Active DEX liquidity for sandwich attacks

### Attack Path

1. Attacker identifies target with existing approvals
2. Creates order on behalf of target with 99.99% slippage
3. When order executes:
    - Attacker sandwiches the trade
    - Extracts maximum value through extreme slippage
    - Profits from target's losses
4. Repeats for other victims with approvals

### Impact

- Theft of user funds through forced unfavorable trades
- Loss of user assets through approval exploitation

### Mitigation

```solidity
function createOrder(...) external {
    require(msg.sender == recipient, "Only recipient can create order");
    require(
        takeProfitSlippage <= 1000 && // Max 10% slippage
        stopSlippage <= 1000 &&
        swapSlippage <= 1000,
        "Slippage too high"
    );
    // Continue with order creation
}
```

## [H-05] Attacker can use malicious token with hook in `oracleLess` to cause loss of funds to users

### Summary

A reentrancy vulnerability in OracleLess contract allows malicious tokens with hooks as the tokenOut or tokenIn to manipulate the pending orders array during order execution, potentially leading to unauthorized order deletions for other user

### Root Cause

The `execute` function makes external calls to untrusted contracts before state changes, allowing reentrancy through token hooks or malicious ERC20 implementations.

the `target` here doesn't have to be a malicious contract, it can be a normal router with a pool of USDT/maliciousToken, so its not the same like other reentrency vulnerabilities

### Internal pre-conditions

- State changes occur after external calls
- Pending orders array manipulation vulnerable to reentrancy

### External pre-conditions

- Malicious token with hooks or custom transfer logic
- Ability to create orders with any tokens in oracleLess, no whitelisting happens in oracleLess
- Multiple orders in pending array

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates order with malicious token
2. During execution, token's transfer hook triggers
3. Hook call the malicious attacker contract (it will be part of transfer logic ..etc) that calls cancelOrder of his own order and transfer 1 wei of tokenOut to pass the minAmountOut >, and his order gets deleted and tokens refunded
4. after the `execute`, the contract try to delete orderId index again from the array, which will be another Id of inoscent user, causing loss of funds to him or unauthorized order cancellation

### Impact

- Unauthorized order deletions
- Potential loss of user funds
  
## [M-01] attacker can dos the time sensetive `fillStopLimitOrder::stopLimit`

### Summary

The `fillStopLimitOrder::stopLimit` call can be DOSed by an attacker continuously creating orders in the Bracket contract until reaching `maxPendingOrders`. causing unavailability of time sensitive function execution

### Root Cause

Orders can be created for free, Layer 2 gas are cheep, Attacker can create order on invalid pair of supported tokens like (USDT/USDT) risking no market exposure in the DOS and making it non executable order that mandates manual handeling from the admin to call `adminCancelOrder`

### Internal pre-conditions

- StopLimit order ready for execution (`inRange`) or near to be `inRange`

### External pre-conditions

- Attacker can create cheap orders (e.g., USDT-USDT pairs)
- Gas costs acceptable for attack
- Attacker continuously track a specific order to DOS, and once he sees that order became `inRange` then he starts his attack to keep Dosing the execution

### Attack Path

1. Monitor StopLimit orders close to execution or already `inRange`
2. When target order nears execution or becomes `inRange` price he creates Orders filling the maxPendingOrders in bracket.sol
3. StopLimit's `performUpkeep` tries to call `fillStopLimitOrder`
4. Call reverts due to maxPendingOrders reached in Bracket.sol

### Impact

- Denial of service for StopLimit orders
- Missed trading opportunities
- System reliability compromised
  
## [M-02] wrong logical operator in `PythOracle` Forcing Stale prices only

### Summary

in `PythOracle` where the staleness check is inverted (`<` instead of `>`), causing the contract to only accept stale prices and reject fresh ones.

### Root Cause

The logical operator in the staleness check is incorrect:

```solidity
require(
    price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```

This requires the price publish time to be OLDER than the allowed freshness window, opposite of intended behavior.

### Internal pre-conditions

- PythOracle is deployed and used for price feeds
- noOlderThan parameter is set (e.g., 2 days)

### External pre-conditions

- Pyth price feed is operational
- Price updates are being published

### Attack Path

1. Fresh price update comes from Pyth
2. publishTime is recent (e.g., current timestamp - 1 minute)
3. Check `publishTime < block.timestamp - 2 days` fails
4. Transaction reverts despite having fresh price

### Impact

- All fresh prices are rejected
- Only stale prices would pass validation
- System becomes unusable
- Trading operations fail

### Mitigation

Fix the operator to `>`:

```solidity
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
    IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
    require(
        price.publishTime > block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
        "Stale Price"
    );
    return uint256(uint64(price.price));
}
```
